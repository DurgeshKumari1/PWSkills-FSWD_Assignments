/*5. You are given a JavaScript object representing a student's information. Your task is to use the 'for...in' loop
to iterate over the properties of the object and perform various operations.

const student={
name: "Alice",
age:22,
major: "Computer Science",
GPA: 3.8,
isEnrolled: true
};
a. Create a function displayStudentInfo that takes the student object as a parameter. Inside this function, use a
'for...in' loop to iterate over the properties of the student object and print each property and its corresponding
value to the console. The output should look something like this:
Property: name, Value:Alice
Property:age, Value:22
Property: major, Value:Computer Science
PRoperty:GPA, Value:3.8
Property: isEnrolled, Value:true
*/

const student = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 22,
    major: "Computer Science",
    GPA: 3.8,
    isEnrolled: true
};

function displayStudentInfo(student) {
    for (const property in student) {
        if (student.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
            console.log(`Property: ${property}, Value: ${student[property]}`);
        }
    }
}

// Call the function to display the student's information
displayStudentInfo(student);
